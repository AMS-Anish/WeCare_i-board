# WeCare-iBoard
WeCare-iBoard is an interactive board developed by the Team Hugo of University of Saarland.
The project is supported by the Human-Computer Interaction group of Saarland University.

The theme of the project is to build interactive robots that bring us together, especially during the Covid situation.

## Description
WeCare-iBoards work in pairs, one for each user. Connected wirelessly, the boards let the two users interact with each other. The user places portable cubes on top of the board and this activates the othe iBoard. The iBoard2 follows the placement of the portable cubes on iBoard1, which makes this device tangible and let users feel more connected. The project aims at letting the users transfer emotions ideally and also do other fun activities like play games. The iBoards are originally designed to be mounted on the wall but later can also be scaled for some portability.
